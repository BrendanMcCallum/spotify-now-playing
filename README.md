# Spotify - now playing

This is a popup that shows Spotify current playback information, made and tested specially for macOS. It also allows you to add tracks to your library and playlists.

## Installing

Download the `.dmg` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/davicorreiajr/spotify-now-playing/releases/latest), run it and move the app to the `Application` folder.

## Running locally

This app was made using Electron, but developed and tested only on macOS.

First, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/davicorreiajr/spotify-now-playing
cd spotify-now-playing
```

Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Then you have to create an app on Spotify, in order to get the codes necessary for doing the requests to its API. You can do it easly, following [this tutorial](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/#register-your-app).

Once you have done this, create a `.env.json` file in the root of this project, with the following content:
```
{
  "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID": '<client_id_from_the_app_you_just_created>',
  "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET": '<client_secret_from_the_app_you_just_created>',
  "SPOTIFY_SCOPES": "user-read-playback-state user-modify-playback-state playlist-read-collaborative playlist-read-private playlist-modify-public playlist-modify-private user-library-modify",
  "REDIRECT_URI": '<redirect_uri_you_used_to_create_the_app>'
}
```

And finally, start the app:
```
npm start
```

If you are developing over this project and want to test the built app, the one generated by `electron-builder`, you have to:
- rename `electron-builder-example.yml` to `electron-builder.yml`;
- generate a token with repo/scope permission [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new), ONLY in case you want to release to your GitHub repo. And remember to update the link to your repo in `package.json`.

And then, you run:
```
npm run dist
```
With this command, you are going to find a `.dmg` file inside a new folder `dist`.
